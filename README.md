# kudos
This application allows you to send "Kudos" to other members of the app. With more work, it could be designed with a login feature and only allow a logged in user to send kudos from their own profile to other members of the site. It was built to display my understanding of MongoDB, AJAX requests, and tying everything together with some JavaScript/jQuery.
